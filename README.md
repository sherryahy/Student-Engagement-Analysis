Our project aims to analyze K-12 student engagement according to school district features such as geographic and demographic context, and digital learning platform features such as educational levels, and draw a conclusion on how these factors affect the  student engagement. Multiple datasets are collected and cleaned for further analysis. Data cleaning is processed with datasets merging, dealing with missing values, data transformation, etc. Data analysis and visualization is completed using AWS and Jupyter Notebook to study the effect of the COVID-19 Pandemic on student engagement with different digital learning platforms.
