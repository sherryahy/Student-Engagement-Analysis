### By Chujie Cai, Yijia Li, Haiyan An, Yuzhuo Gao 11/21/2021

Our project aims to analyze K-12 student engagement according to school district features such
as geographic and demographic context, and digital learning platform features such as educational
levels, and draw a conclusion on how these factors affect the learning outcomes. Multiple datasets
will be collected and cleaned for further analysis. Data cleaning will be processed with datasets merging,
dealing with missing values, data transformation, etc. Correlation analysis will be completed using Python
DataFrame to study the features that may affect student engagement on different learning platforms.
